        I'm a 21 y/o frontend engineer from üìç Bangalore, India. I'm currently
        studying at DSCE and I'm working as a Software Development Engineer 1 at{" "}

      <p className="mt-8">
        There are quite a few niche domains that i'm interested in besides tech.

          I've developed an interest in watches ‚åöÔ∏è after starting my
          collection. I absolutely love dive watches and those with integrated
          bracelets.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've developed an indulgence for fragrances and have a small but a
          growing collection of fragrances.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm very much into star-wars ‚ú®. At any given point of time there is a
          20% chance that i'll make a star-wars quote or a reference.
        </li>
        <li>
          I'm also interested in mechanical keyboards. I use a Keychrom K2V2 ‚å®Ô∏è
          and plan to build a custom keyboard soon. Also no, i'm not a socipath,
          i don't use blue switches.

        I tend to spend my free time working on some hobby projects like this
        site or <CustomLink href="https://mark3.vercel.app">Mark</CustomLink>, contributing to
        open source or reading tech blogs.
