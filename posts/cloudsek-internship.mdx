# Background

If you're reading this, then it means that i've successfully completed my internship at CloudSEK and that i've almost completed 1 year at CloudSEK.
I'm writing this blog post to share my experience at CloudSEK and to document my learnings.
I joined CloudSEK as an SDE Intern on November 2022 where i joined the Core Platform Engineering team which builds the main product of CloudSEK, i.e. The CloudSEK Platform.

# About CloudSEK

CloudSEK is a SaaS based company which provides a platform for monitoring the security of an organization's digital assets.
We monitor various sources on the internet for any security threats and alert our customers if we find any.
We also provide a dashboard where our customers can view all the alerts and take necessary actions.

The Core Platform Engineering team is responsible for building the CloudSEK Platform.
This team has sub-teams within it which are responsible for building different parts of the platform.
I was a part of the frontend team.

# The Onboarding

The onboarding process was pretty smooth. I had a pleaseant surprise when i received my onboarding kit which some nice goodies.
I met most of the people in the team and got to know about the work that they do through an introductory call.

CloudSEK has a culture of introducing new-hires to the entire company through a company-wide call also known as AHM (all hands meeting).
Here comes the interesting part, there is a tradition of roasting new-hires in the AHM. It's like [Tech Roast Show](https://www.instagram.com/techroastshow/?hl=en)
except you get roasted by the audience. But it's all in good spirit and it's a great way to get to know the people in the company.

Fast forward to a couple of days, i finished setting up my development environment, got access to the required tools and permissions and was ready to start working on my first ticket.
Since i was already familiar with the tech stack that the frontend team uses, i was able to start submitting pull-requests within the fist few days itself.

# The Internship Experience

The frontend codebase had a familiar tech stack which included React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, Chakra UI, etc.
I was already familiar with most of these technologies and had worked with some of them in the past.

## Challenges and Learnings

### 1. Reducing re-renders in React



### 2. Adopting A Server-Driven UI Architecture

### 3. Building Advanced Query Builder

## Beyond the internship

### Conferences

I got a chance to attend a couple of international conferences during my internship.
I was able to attend [JSConf India](https://jsconf.in/) and [React Nexus](https://reactnexus.com/) in-person both of which were fully sponsored by CloudSEK âœ¨.

### Parties ðŸŽ‰

If you're a party monster then you'll love CloudSEK. We have some coolest parties / team-offsites in some of the best places in the BLR.
Since the office is located in Indiranagar, there are many more impromptu events that keep happening.

### Tech Talks

We have a culture of sharing knowledge and learning from each other.
We often arrange tech talks where someone from the team presents something that they've been working on.
It could be anything from a new technology that they've been exploring to a new feature that they've been working on or a problem that they've been trying to solve.

I got a chance to deliver a tech talk on React Server Components which was a new feature that was introduced in React 18.
The talk focused on the motivation behind introducing this feature and how it works under the hood.
I also talked about the benefits of using this feature and how it can be leveraged to reduce the bundle size of a React application.

# Was it worth it?

YES, Absolutely!!! if i got a chance to go back in time and do it again, i'd definitely do it without hesitation.
I got to learn a lot of things and work with some really smart individuals.
I also got to work on some really interesting and challenging problems. It was a transformational experience in every sense.
I became a far better developer than i was before i joined CloudSEK. My skillsets, confidence and knowledge grew exponentially ðŸ“ˆ.

The opportunity to work on some deep technical problems and the freedom to choose the tools and technologies to solve those
problems was the best part of the internship.This is exactly what i was looking for when i was searching for an internship.
