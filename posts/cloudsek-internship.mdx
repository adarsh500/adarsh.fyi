# Background

If you're reading this, then it means that i've successfully completed my internship at CloudSEK and that i've almost completed 1 year at CloudSEK.
I'm writing this blog post to share my experience at CloudSEK and to document my learnings.
I joined CloudSEK as an SDE Intern on November 2022 where i joined the Core Platform Engineering team which builds the main product of CloudSEK, i.e. The CloudSEK Platform.

# About CloudSEK

CloudSEK is a SaaS based company which provides a platform for monitoring the security of an organization's digital assets.
We monitor various sources on the internet for any security threats and alert our customers if we find any.
We also provide a dashboard where our customers can view all the alerts and take necessary actions.

The Core Platform Engineering team is responsible for building the CloudSEK Platform.
This team has sub-teams within it which are responsible for building different parts of the platform.
I was a part of the Frontend team.

# The Onboarding

The onboarding process was pretty smooth. I had a pleaseant surprise when i received my onboarding kit which some nice goodies.
I met most of the people in the team and got to know about the work that they do through an introductory call.

CloudSEK has a culture of introducing new-hires to the entire company through a company-wide call also known as AHM (all hands meeting).
Here comes the interesting part, there is a tradition of roasting / teasing the new-hires in the AHM. But it's all in good fun and it's a great way to get to know the people in the company.

Fast forward to a couple of days, i finished setting up my development environment, got access to the required tools and permissions and was ready to start working on my first task.
Since i was already familiar with the tech stack that the frontend team uses, i was able to start submitting pull-requests within the fist few days itself.

# The Internship Experience

The frontend team had a familiar tech stack which included React, Next.js, TypeScript, React Query, Chakra UI, etc.
