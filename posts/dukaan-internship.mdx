# How did i land the internship?

Going back to March 2022. I had decided not to appy for GSoC that year.
Since i had plenty of time due to online classes, i decided to start hunting for internships.I had started actively applying for internships from february.

I had heard of Dukaan through twitter before. I decided to do some digging around twitter for people who work there, and i ended up following a few of them.
Few days later, Subhash (CTO of Dukaan) posted a tweet about hiring interns, and i had my twitter notifications enabled. I immediately applied for the internship.
The link was disabled after a few hours, and i was lucky enough to apply for it in time.

# The interview process

I had applied for the internship on 31st March. I got a call on the next day itself. I had a couple of rounds of interviews and then a final round with Subhash.
All the rounds were finished on the same day and i was hired on the spot. Name a better interview process, i'll wait. The interviews were very quick they involved a few js questions. But it was mostly based on my projects.

# The internship

I had an amazing time working at Dukaan. I worked on the buyer-side of the frontend team. My team handled all of the UI that you can see on any store that is running on Dukaan. My work mostly revolved around plugins that merchants could add to their store and the theming-engine.

This was my first internship and i had absolutely no idea on what to expect from it. I had no experience working with large codebases or any previous internships. But this was all the more reason for me to take up this internship. I wanted to learn how to work with a large codebase and how to work with a team. 

### Day 0
I still do remember my day 0 here, i was super pumped. The thought that i would get to make impactful changes to a product that is used by thousands of people was very exciting. I also got to meet Harnoor Singh that day, who's a tech YouTuber. 

Here's some of the things i worked on:
1. Review plugin
