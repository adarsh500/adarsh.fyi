[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), one of the most popular preprocessors, allows you to write more reusable, maintainable CSS.
Some of the most popular features are [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), and [modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules).

We just used a `###` subheading in our blog post.

```js
const doStuff = () => {
  return console.log("hey");
};

// this is a code block
const doSomething = () => {
  return console.log("hey");
};
```
